# Programming 2 Project – Object-Oriented Java Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Programming 2 course.
It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java through a system that models different real-world objects such as devices, animals, food items, and ships.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming principles including inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, interfaces, and polymorphism using Java.

## ✅ Features
- Abstract base class (Ship)
- Multiple subclasses (Mouse, Screen, Banana, Bird, Ball)
- Interface implementation (ColorFul, TechnicalDevice)
- Method overriding and polymorphism
- UML class diagram included

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- UML Class Diagram Design

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java Programming
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Interface Implementation
- UML Class Design
- Problem Solving
- Logical Thinking

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile the Java file
2. Run the main class:
   `ProjectJava`
3. The program displays information about different objects created using OOP concepts.
